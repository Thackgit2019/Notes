Chapter 2:

etc/passwd shows guid but does not show passwd

etc/shadow can show password but might be encrypted?

sudo adduser - gives fields to work with and adds the <username>
sudo passwd <username> - changes password of a user
sudo su - <username> - switches accounts, use exit to go back to prev
sudo groupadd <name> - adds group <name>
sudo usermod -g <groupname> <username> - switches primary group with -g option
sudo gpasswd -d <username> <grouptoremove> - remove a user from a group
sudo passwd -l <username> - lock a user account -u to unlock
sudo chage -l <username> - views when  password expires etc.
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> - gives other users root access

using visudo you can give users access to various permissions, has a makefile format
	example: <user> ALL=(ALL:ALL) /sbin/reboot,/sbin/shutdown gives <user> reboot and shutdown perms
	
-x = perm to run executable files
	order = rwx, --- means no perms
	
setting permissions onf iles and directories:
	object type -- user -- group -- world
			rw-	rw-	rw-
			rw-	r--	r--
			rwx	rwx	r-x
			
for directories:
	r = contents can be viewed
	w = contents of directory can be altered
	x = the user or group can use cd to go inside the dir
	
	
to remove permissions for directories and files example:
	chmod o-r /home/<user>/<file> 
	this removes read perms for other users other than group/self
	chmod o+r gives the perm back
	
Read: 4, Write: 2, Execute: 1
example:
	600: user has read + write equiv to -rw-------

chmod 770 -R <directory> - changes to all the files and directories underneath to 770

chown command to change ownership or give access to an object
example:
	sudo chown <user>:<group>:<etc> <file>
	(does not need more than <user>)
	chgrp works as well as a replacement for chown
	

Chapter 3: Managing Software Packages (incomplete)

sudo apt update - updates package sources
sudo apt remove <package> 
	--purge to wipe configuration

which - command to find the location of the binary file for comands that are available
	if not avail, no output
	
to update a package, use refresh:
	sudo snap refresh <package>
	
look up packages on http://packages.ubuntu.com/

apt advanced package tool - suite of tools that allows us to install, remove, and update Deb packages

running sudo apt update after handling/dealing with packages is good practice

ppa personal package archive - another form of apt repository


Chapter 4: Navigating and Essential Commands

head/tail <file> - shows first ten or last ten lines respectively
	-n <number> to vary lines
	-f displays new lines as they are appended, real time
	

Chapter 5: Managing Files and Directories

:sp to split the screen (vim)

standard output
	cat /var/log/syslog > /logfile.txt - redirects standard output of syslog into logfile.txt
	>> to append and not overwrite
	
file descriptors:
	0 standard input
	1 standard output
	2 standard error
	
/dev/null is a special device where things disappear forever
	find / name "syslog" 2> /def/null
	
find / -name "syslog" 1> stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt
	redirecting successful output to stdout.txt and errors to stderr.txt.
	
creating links - ln file1 file3
		 ls -i  to look at what are linked to each other using the inode number
		 
		 
Chapter 10: Connecting to Networks:

sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname> - changes hostname
sudo ip link set enp0s3 down/up - preventing from connecting to networks / connecting to net
	en for ethernet, wl for wireless
	p references which bus is being used, p0 refers to the first bus
	s3 references the PCI slot (3)
	
view /etc/netplan directory to see how .yaml files are formatted
if dhcp4 is true, this means that ip addresses are dynamically allocated, generally we want a static ip 
ip address should be selected not from the range broadcasted
sudo netplan apply - to apply changes
